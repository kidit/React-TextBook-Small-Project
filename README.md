# React Textbook Small Project

This repository contains example code and small projects as demonstrated in the React textbook. It includes setups for `immer` and `react-router-dom` among other React utilities and libraries.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Immer Setup and Usage

Immer is used to work with immutable state in a more convenient way. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Create the project**

    ```bash
    yarn create react-app immer-tutorial
    ```

2. **Move to the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd immer-tutorial
    ```

3. **Add Immer package**

    ```bash
    yarn add immer
    ```

### React Router DOM Setup and Usage

React Router DOM enables dynamic routing in a web app. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Create the project**

    ```bash
    yarn create react-app router-tutorial
    ```

2. **Move to the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd router-tutorial
    ```

3. **Add React Router DOM package**

    ```bash
    yarn add react-router-dom
    ```

### Parcel Project Setup

1. **Download Parcel bundler**

    ```bash
    yarn global add parcel-bundler
    # If the above command doesn't work
    npm install -g parcel-bundler
    ```

2. **Create a project directory**

    ```bash
    mkdir vanilla-redux
    ```

3. **Move to the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd vanilla-redux
    ```

4. **Create a package.json file**

    ```bash
    yarn init -y
    ```

5. **Start the server using Parcel**

    ```bash
    parcel index.html
    ```

6. **Add Redux to the project**

    ```bash
    yarn add redux
    ```

### React-Redux Setup and Usage

1. **Create the React project**

    ```bash
    yarn create react-app react-redux-tutorial
    ```

2. **Move to the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd react-redux-tutorial
    ```

3. **Add Redux and React-Redux**

    ```bash
    yarn add redux react-redux
    ```

4. **Add Redux DevTools Extension**
    - Note: Redux DevTools Extension must be installed to see the app states.

    ```bash
    yarn add redux-devtools-extension
    ```

5. **Add Redux-Actions**

    ```bash
    yarn add redux-actions
    ```

6. **Add Immer**

    ```bash
    yarn add immer
    ```
