# React Textbook Small Project

This repository contains example code and small projects as demonstrated in the React textbook. It includes setups for `immer` and `react-router-dom` among other React utilities and libraries.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Immer Setup and Usage

Immer is used to work with immutable state in a more convenient way. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Create the project**

    ```bash
    yarn create react-app immer-tutorial
    ```

2. **Move to the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd immer-tutorial
    ```

3. **Add Immer package**

    ```bash
    yarn add immer
    ```

### React Router DOM Setup and Usage

React Router DOM enables dynamic routing in a web app. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Create the project**

    ```bash
    yarn create react-app router-tutorial
    ```

2. **Move to the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd router-tutorial
    ```

3. **Add React Router DOM package**

    ```bash
    yarn add react-router-dom
    ```

### Final Steps

After downloading each file and package, please download the file posted on the corresponding GitHub repository. Compare it with the installed file and overwrite it if they have the same name to ensure consistency and functionality as demonstrated in the textbook.
